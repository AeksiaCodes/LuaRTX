# LuaRTX

Hi everyone (Alison)!

## This is a little Lua raytracer I've been making, based (loosely) off Peter Shirley's 'Ray Tracing in One Weekend'

**Notes:**
> This project is NOT complete. I am currently at about chapter 5.1 of the book. The current code renders a sphere with normal values

> The code is likely terrible. I will not fix it anytime soon.

> The vector library I used is from https://github.com/themousery/vector.lua. I modified it to work with 3D Vectors, but I didn't change every/all functions. While you're welcome to use it ~~terribly~~ as is, I'll be expanding on its 3D functionality in the future.


### Cheers!
