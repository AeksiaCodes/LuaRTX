# LuaRTX

Hi everyone (Alison)!

## This is a little Lua raytracer I've been making, based (loosely) off Peter Shirley's 'Ray Tracing in One Weekend'

**Notes:**
> This project is basically complete. It doesn't quite do everything, but I'm lazy, and have issues with sticking to projects, so this is as far as I'll get. It just renders a few spheres

> The code is likely terrible. I will not fix it anytime soon.

> The vector library I used is from https://github.com/themousery/vector.lua. I modified it to work with 3D Vectors, but I didn't change every/all functions. While you're welcome to use it ~~terribly~~ as is, I'll be expanding on its 3D functionality in the future.


### Cheers!
